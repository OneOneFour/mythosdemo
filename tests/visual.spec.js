   VISUAL REGRESSION

   `tools/check.mjs` verifies behaviour and explicitly cannot verify
   appearance. This covers that gap — and only that gap. A passing
   screenshot means the pixels have not CHANGED. It does not mean they
   are right; that still needs a human.

   These baselines were taken immediately after the architecture
   refactor and are UNREVIEWED. Treat the first human look at the game
   as the real acceptance test, and re-baseline deliberately after it.

   Diffs are bit-exact (maxDiffPixels: 0) because the renderer is
   deterministic by construction: seeded RNG, rendering consumes no
   randomness, integer-only pixels, and a bitmap font drawn with
   fillRect rather than fillText.

   BELTS

   transform: it drags a RESTING item along its footprint for as long as its
   machine record holds a fuel-bought CHARGE, and does nothing the instant it
   does not. A screenshot cannot tell "moved" from "always looked like this",
   so all three tests below read item and machine state back directly.

   Every test hand-carves its own small patch of the surface band -- clearing
   a rectangle to air and forcing a solid floor under exactly the belt's own
   four-tile footprint -- rather than trusting that seed 1337's natural
   terrain happens to have a flat run near spawn. That is the same caution
   CLAUDE.md's furnace story is about: a test that only ever finds rock
   nearby would report "refused" as if it were "did not drag".
   ============================================================ */

   `placeMachine` refuses it as occupied); `ty0+1` under the WHOLE span is
